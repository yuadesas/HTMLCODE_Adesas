        <h2> My HTML Journey from <mark> Chaos </mark> to <mark> Cat Videos </mark> </h2>
        <h3> Or, how I accidentally created a self-pacing cat video website (and almost lost my sanity) </h3> 
        <p> Armed with boundless <i> enthusiasm </i> and <i> zero coding experience, </i> I embarked on my quest to conquer <mark> HTML </mark> <br>      
        <i> Little </i> did I know my journey would be <i> less </i> <b> "Lord of the Rings" </b> and more <b> :Three Stooges" </b> </p> 
        <p> My <ins> first website </ins> lovingly named <b> "Brenda's Blossomming Boutique" </b>, resembled a digital <mark> Jackson Pollock </mark> painting. <br>
            Tags were <del> scattered </del> like <i> confetti, colors clashed </i> like a sunset on <mark> Mars, </mark> and the navigation system could only be <br> 
            described as <b> "whimsical" </b> <sub> <i> (by a very generous browser). </sub> </i> </p>
        <p> Determined to redeem myself, I tackled a <b> "simple" </b> project: <mark> a cat video gallery </mark> . What ensued was a <i> hilarious </i> <br>
        <sup> (and slightly terrifying) </sup> <ins> ballet of misplaced semicolons,</ins> <ins> rogue line breaks, </ins> and <ins> images </ins> that danced uncontrollably <br>
        <del> across </del> the screen. At one point, my entire website transformed into an <i> auto-playing cat video slideshow, </i> <br>
          much to the amusement <sub> (and slight concern) </sub> of my family. </p>
        <p> After <ins> several meltdowns,</ins> <ins> countless tutorials, </ins> and <ins> gallons of coffee, </ins> I finally managed to wrangle my code into <i> submission.</i> <br>
        My cat video gallery wasn't exactly <b> "elegant"</b>, but it functioned <sup> (mostly). </sup> And hey, at least I learned that even the <mark> clumsiest <br>
        coder </mark> can create  something... <i> interesting. </i> So, here's to <mark> Brenda's Blossoming Boutique </mark> . <mark> <i> the self- playing cat video extravaganza </mark> </i> <br>
        and the <del> never-ending </del> quest to master the art of <mark> <b> HTML.! </mark> </b> </p>
